You are given N positive integers.

For each given integer A, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.


Example Input

Input 1:

 2
 4
 6 
Input 2:

 1
 3 


Example Output

Output 1:

 NO
 YES 
Output 2:
 NO 
 
Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 For A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4. 
 For A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6. 
Explanation 2:

 For A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3.
